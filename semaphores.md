# Semaphores

# What is a SEMAPHORE?
1. When you create one, you can initialize to any value
2. You can only change its state by using increment and decrement
3. When a thread increments a semaphore one of the waiting threads gets unblocked

Thread is blocked: thread tells a scheduler that it cannot proceed. Scheduler does not let thread to run untill there is an event that occurs and unblocks (wakes) thread.
